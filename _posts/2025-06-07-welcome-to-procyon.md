Welcome to the official blog of the Procyon Project! This is where I'll be sharing updates about our
Kotlin Multiplatform apps for the Fediverse, development progress, and thoughts on decentralized
social media.

## What is Procyon?

The Procyon Project consists of two main applications:

- **Raccoon for Lemmy**: A modern client for the federated link aggregator
- **Raccoon for Friendica**: Your gateway to the Friendica social network

Both apps are built with Kotlin Multiplatform and follow modern Android development practices while
prioritizing user privacy and the principles of open source software.

## Why the Fediverse matters

Traditional social media platforms have centralized control over billions of users' data,
connections, and conversations. The Fediverse offers an alternative - a network of interconnected
but independently operated social platforms.

This means:

- You own your data and can move between servers
- No single company controls your social graph
- Communities can set their own rules and moderation policies
- Open source software ensures transparency and auditability

## What's coming next

In this blog I am going to share my insights on the following main areas:

- Development challenges with technical deep-dives
- History of the Procyon project and the community around it
- Reasoning on the Fediverse to understand its dynamics and tips for newcomers
- News on the development process, with updates on new features
- UI design with a focus on user experience

Stay tuned for more updates, and **thank you** for supporting open source software and digital
freedom!
