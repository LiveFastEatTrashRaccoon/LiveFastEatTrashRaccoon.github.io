## A Community-driven approach

The Raccoon apps are Kotlin Multiplatform clients for Friendica and Lemmy that embody the spirit of
open-source collaboration. At Procyon, every contribution is welcome and everyone's opinion is
valued, emphasizing that this is a community project, open source, ad-free and free of charge, so it
belongs to us all.

## Our philosophy

Procyon encourages contributors to embrace the raccoon motto: **#livefasteattrash** ‚Äî a playful
reminder that this is a community-driven effort where experimentation and contribution are
encouraged.

## Living by the R.A.C.C.O.O.N. Code of Conduct

What makes us special isn't just its code ‚Äî it's the principles that guide its community. The
project follows the **R.A.C.C.O.O.N. code of conduct**, where each letter represents a core value:

**ü¶ù Respect**: We respect each other as people, remembering we are part of a group that goes
beyond individual opinions, beliefs, preferences and habits.

**ü¶ù Availability**: We support each other with the skills and available time that we have,
considering that we are volunteers and we operate on a best-effort basis.
**ü¶ù Commitment**: We are responsible for our choices and we agree that our choices are taken
wisely, always considering the impact on other members of the group.

**ü¶ù Cohesion**: We remember that we are part of a community which is bigger than the individual
members, so we do unto others as we would have them do unto us.

**ü¶ù Objectivity**: We are committed to telling the truth in the most objective way and, if we
express subjective opinions, to do it in a clear and constructive way.

**ü¶ù Originality**: We bring our own personal experience and ideas which are acceptable even if "
different": everyone's voice matters and deserves to be listened.

**ü¶ù Never give up**: We are tenacious and are not afraid by technical challenges, we embrace
every difficult task as an opportunity to learn and acquire new skills.

## Community impact

Procyon has been shaped by the huge amount of patience and dedication of early adopters who sent
continuous feedback and ideas for improvement after every release, reported bugs, offered to help,
and submitted translations through Weblate.

## Join us

Whether you're a seasoned developer or a newcomer to open source, Procyon welcomes your
contributions. The project's inclusive approach ensures that every voice matters in building a
better Friendica or Lemmy client for the community.
