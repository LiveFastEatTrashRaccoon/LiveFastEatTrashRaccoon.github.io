**Tired of the endless tap-back-tap dance? There's a better way to browse.**

Picture this: You're deep-diving into your Mastodon timeline when you spot an intriguing post. You
tap to read the full discussion, scan through replies, then… *tap back*. Find your place again.
Tap the next post. Repeat. Does it sound familiar?

What if scrolling through social content felt as natural as flipping through a magazine? Enter
**swipe navigation** – the game-changing UX pattern that's transforming how we consume Fediverse
content.

## The Problem: lost in navigation hell

Every Fediverse platform has its building blocks – Lemmy's *posts*, Mastodon/GNU social's
*statuses*, Friendica's *items* – but they all share the same fundamental challenge. These content
units live in lists: timelines, author feeds, community threads, search results. And traditionally,
exploring them means constant context switching.

The typical mobile experience goes like this:

1. Scroll through feed
2. Tap interesting content
3. Read, engage, absorb
4. **Hit back** (losing your flow)
5. Hunt for where you left off
6. Repeat until frustrated

This master-detail navigation works on large screens, but on mobile? It's a focus-killer and
engagement-destroyer.

## The solution: think like a book, not a database

Swipe navigation flips the script – literally. Instead of treating content as isolated database
entries, it transforms your feed into a flowing narrative where each post is simply the next page in
your story.

**Swipe right**: Previous content  
**Swipe left**: Next content  
**Stay engaged**: Never lose your place

It's that simple. No more navigation gymnastics, no more losing your scroll position, no more
breaking your reading flow.

## The Technical Magic Behind the Scenes

Making this feel effortless requires some clever engineering. Here's how we solved it in the Raccoon
apps:

### Smart Pagination Memory

We maintain a "snapshot" of your current browsing context:

- current pagination specification i.e. all the data which are needed, if you
  have page _n_, to get page _n+1_;
- partial list of all the contents which have been downloaded so far;
- current pagination status (e.g. the current page index or the next "pagination token", the
  information about whether there are more pages or not).

### Intelligent prefetching

As you swipe toward the end of loaded content, the app quietly fetches the next batch in the
background. You get the illusion of infinite content without wait times, data waste or battery
draining, because only as much contents are downloaded as they are likely to be seen.

### Context navigation stack

Here's where things get interesting. What happens when you're browsing your home timeline, then dive
into someone's profile, then start swiping through *their* posts?

We solved this with a navigation stack – think of it as breadcrumbs for your browsing session. Each
time you enter a new feed context, we push a new state onto the stack. When you navigate back, we
pop it off and restore exactly where you were in the previous feed.

**Example flow:**

1. Browsing home timeline (State A)
2. Open user profile → New context (State B pushed)
3. Swipe through their posts using State B pagination
4. Hit back → Pop State B, restore State A
5. Continue exactly where you left off in home timeline

## Why this matters for the Fediverse

This isn't just about smoother UX – it's about **engagement and adoption**. The Fediverse is
competing with highly polished corporate platforms that have spent billions optimizing user
experience.

Swipe navigation levels the playing field by:

- **Reducing friction**: fewer taps, less cognitive load
- **Maintaining flow state**: users stay immersed in content
- **Feeling native**: matches expected mobile interaction patterns
- **Encouraging exploration**: easier to discover new content and creators

## The Relay legacy

Fun fact: This navigation pattern gained popularity in the Reddit ecosystem through the Relay app,
which is why some developers still call it "Relay-style navigation." It proved so effective that it
became a sought-after feature across Threadiverse clients, and now it's making its way into broader
Fediverse apps.

## Building a better social web

Every interaction pattern we choose shapes how people experience the open social web. Swipe
navigation might seem like a small UX detail, but it represents something bigger: the commitment to
making decentralized platforms not just functional, but *delightful*.

When users can lose themselves in their feeds – really get into that flow state where time
disappears and content discovery feels effortless – that's when the Fediverse truly competes with
the walled gardens.

The future of social media is open, decentralized, and user-controlled. But it also needs to feel
*amazing* to use. Swipe navigation is one piece of that puzzle, turning mechanical browsing into
intuitive exploration.

**Ready to transform your Fediverse experience?** Look for apps that support swipe navigation, or if
you're a developer, consider implementing this pattern in your next project. Your users' engagement
levels will thank you.
