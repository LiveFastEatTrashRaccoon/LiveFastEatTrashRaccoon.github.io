# About the Procyon Project

The Procyon Project was born from a simple belief: social media should serve people, not
corporations.

## Our Mission

We're building open source Kotlin Multiplatform applications that make the Fediverse accessible to
everyone. Our goal is to create beautiful, user-friendly apps that help people connect through
decentralized social networks without sacrificing privacy or digital rights.

## Why "Procyon"?

Procyon is Latin word for "raccoon" and raccoons are adorable, aren't they? Such cute and
intelligent animals definitely deserve more recognition!

The original Lemmy app was called Raccoon, following a tradition according to which Lemmy clients
were named after small mammals (Lemmur, Jerboa, Fennec, etc.). The idea was so nice that it became
natural to name the Friendica client after it.

Raccoons are very clever animals that adapt to live in harsh conditions, finding a way to survive
even with what we consider ¬´trash¬ª. They look like masked criminals but do not harm anyone, they are
lazy, chubby and absolutely cute.

The ü¶ù philosophy can be summarized in four simple words: ¬´Live Fast Eat Trash¬ª (abbreviated
L.F.E.T.).

## The Developer

Hi! I'm an Android developer passionate about Kotlin Multiplatform and open source software. I
believe in the power of free communication and decentralized networks to create a more open,
equitable internet.

When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring the Fediverse, or thinking about how technology can
better serve humanity.
